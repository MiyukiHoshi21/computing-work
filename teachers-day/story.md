It was the 13th of February in the year 2021. Just a random date in the 2021 calendar, right? Wrong. It just so happens that this very day falls on a Friday. The Friday the 13th. <br/>
You're probably thinking that Friday the 13th does not exist, right? Well, let me tell you a story of what happened in the year 2020. Then let's see if your opinion of Fridsy the 13th is still the same. <br/> 
"13th of November. One quarter of the end of year school holiday is already gone..." Mr Ong (Science teacher) sighed as he stared at the calendar on the staffroom wall. <br/>
"I know right? Time flies when we are having fun. Every Friday when we come back to prepare for next year nothing interesting happens and we get dragged back to reality and the fact that the holidays are slipping away at the speed of light." Mr Ho (Computing teacher) added, typing furiously on his computer. <br/>
"You know, today might not be so boring!" Ms Ng (Math teacher) jumped in excitedly, eyes shining. <br/>
"Really? Why so?" Ms Vaz inquired, glancing up from her computer. <br/>
"Oh, I know! It's because it's Friday the 13th right?" Mdm Sim (Chinese teacher) asked, glancing at Ms Ng (Math teacher). Ms Ng (Math teacher) nodded vigorously. <br/> 
"You shouldn't believe in this kind of things. We're grown adults and teachers." Ms Lee (PE teacher) commented, pushing a cart of netballs to the PE storeroom. <br/>
"Yes, it's not scientifically proven that bad things always happen on Friday the 13th." Mrs Chu (Science teacher) remarked before continuing to draw the light digram she was drawing for her future year 1s. <br/>
"But it is fun to think about it." Mr Low (Makerspace teacher) put in, planning an activity for his students. <br/>
"That reminds me, I wonder how is 1H doing, they arranged a meetup in school today." Ms Ng (Geography teacher) pondered out loud, tapping her pencil which she used to draw maps on her chip thoughtfully. <br/>
"Maybe we can go visit them during our lunch break later." Mr Mark (Computing teacher) suggested, not looking up from the code he was working on. <br/>
Woosh! All of a sudden, the door to the staffroom was flung open. <br/>
"Ah, Ms Yick, you're back from the music roo-" Ms Goh (Art teacher) greeted, looking up from a painting she was doing before she was interrupted. <br/>
"H-help!" All the teachers whipped their heads around only to see (Boy 1) gasping for air. He was trying to stablize himself by holding onto the door of the staffroom and looked like he had just run a 100km marathon. <br/>
