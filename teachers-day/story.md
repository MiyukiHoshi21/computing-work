*Story (finally) complete! Thank you to all who helped me by giving suggestions (even if I didn't merge your pull request)! If any of you have any suggestions like for the grammar or vocab please feel free to tell me (I wrote this at 1 am and didn't really check so there could be a lot of mistakes. Sorry! ε(┬┬﹏┬┬)3).*

*Oh yeah, a lot of you didn't tell me which positions you wanted by Monday midnight (do any of you sleep later than this) so I ended up using a random number picker to randomsly pick your register numbers. Please don't kill me. Thanks. ( ◑‿◑)*

It was the 13th of February in the year 2021. Just a random date in the 2021 calendar, right? Wrong. It just so happens that this very day falls on a Friday. Friday the 13th.

You're probably thinking that Friday the 13th does not exist, right? Well, let me tell you a story of what happened in the year 2020. Then let's see if your opinion of Friday the 13th is still the same.

"13th of November. One quarter of the end of year school holiday is already gone..." Mr Ong (SC) sighed as he stared at the calendar on the staff room wall.

"I know right? Time flies when we are having fun. Every Friday when we come back to prepare for next year nothing interesting happens and we get dragged back to reality and the fact that the holidays are slipping away at the speed of light." Mr Ho (Comp) added, typing furiously on his computer.

"You know, today might not be so boring!" Ms Ng (MA) jumped in excitedly, eyes shining behind her pair of red spectacles.

"Really? Why so?" Ms Vaz (EL) inquired, glancing up from her computer.

"Oh, I know! It's because it's Friday the 13th right?" Mdm Sim (CL) asked, glancing at Ms Ng (MA), who nodded vigorously in response.

"You shouldn't believe in this kind of thing. We're grown adults and teachers." Ms Lee (PE) commented, pushing a cart of netballs to the PE storeroom, Mr Chew (PE) following closely behind with another cart.

"Yes, it's not scientifically proven that bad things always happen on Friday the 13th." Mrs Chu (SC) remarked before continuing to draw the light diagram she was drawing for her future year 1s.

"But it is fun to think about it." Mr Low (Makerspace) put in while planning an activity for his students.

"That reminds me, I wonder how is 1H doing, they arranged a meetup in school today." Ms Ng (Geog) pondered out loud, tapping her pencil which she used to draw maps on her chin thoughtfully.

"Maybe we can go visit them during our lunch break later." Mr Ng (Comp) suggested, not looking up from the code he was working on.
Woosh! All of a sudden, the door to the staffroom was flung open.

"Ah, Ms Yick (Music), you're back from the music roo-" Ms Goh (Art) greeted, looking up from a painting she was doing before she was interrupted.

"H-help!" All the teachers whipped their heads around only to see Klemens gasping for air. He was trying to stabilize himself by holding onto the door of the staffroom and looked like he had just run a 1000km marathon.

"Are you okay Klemens? What happened?" Ms Vora (E Lit) asked concernedly, walking over to him.

"I... gasp... the z-zombies... cough cough..." Klemens panted, using his left arm to wipe the beads of sweat that had formed on his forehead.

"Klemens, calm down! Do you want to take a seat?" Ms Chang (Cooking) pointed at a stool by the door.

"Do you need water? I have water." Ms Lie (ACC) offered, holding out a water bottle.

Klemens grabbed the bottle and gulped down the whole drink in 10 seconds. It was a miracle that he didn’t choke.

Klemens looked sheepishly at the teachers for grabbing the bottle earlier but wasted no time in explaining why he was in their staff room. “Help! Darren has somehow made a potion that caused Yi Shen to turn into a zombie!”

Gasps rippled through the teachers who had gathered around Klemens.

“So, how is the situation? Is Yi Shen infecting other classmates?” Mr Lee (TRP) questioned, analysing the situation, and using his White Hat.

“Yi Shen said something in a weird voice and tackled Jiawei to the ground. Before I knew it Jiawei also became a zombie!” Klemens gesticulated wildly as he explained.

Eyes widened one after another. The zombie disease was contagious!

“We need to go save the other kids from 1H! They are not safe as long as they are in the school premises!” Ms Zhang (ACC) exclaimed, already making her way to the staff room door.

“Klemens, lead the way!” Ms Nora (Malay) grinned and everyone started following Klemens out of the staffroom.

*A few moments later*

“We’re here!” Klemens declared, pointing at the field. “The boys and I were playing soccer here before Darren came with the potion.” He clarified.

Screams could be heard, and all the teachers’ eyes were drawn to a side of the field which had a few boys racing away from it.

“Run! Zombies!” Timothy urged everyone as he rushed past with Joshua.

“Wait! We are here to help stop Darren!” Ms Poh (Hist) stopped Timothy and Joshua.

“You wouldn’t want to be bitten by the zombies and turn into one I tell you.” Joshua warned, terrified.

Together, Timothy and Joshua sprinted away.

“Let’s get help from other students.” Mdm Tang (Cooking) muttered, shaking her head.

“Do you need any help?” Sean queried as he neared the group of teachers.

“Okay so we know that the zombie disease can spread by biting like rabies.” Mr Lim (SC) began.

“It’s hard if you want to both stop the zombies and stop them from biting you though.” Klemens piped up.

“Wait, let’s get closer to see how many people are infected first.” Mr Mark (Comp) suggested. Everyone nodded in agreement.

*At the corner of the field*

“Holy cow! Th-they look so different y-yet so recognisable!” Ms Vora (E Lit) stuttered, pointing at the group of zombies.

The zombies looked exactly like the boys they were except they had purple hair, green skin with rotting parts and part of their brain was visible. Everyone shuddered as they stared at the zombified version of Yi Shen, Jiawei, and Adrian.

“Brainsssssss” Adrian groaned and suddenly lunged toward Mrs Chu (SC).

“Look out!” Josh who just happened to be dashing past yelled and pushed Mrs Chu out of the way.

Adrian changed direction and started stumbling toward Josh, only to get whacked in the head by the triumphant Mr Lim (SC) with a tennis racket that happened to be lying nearby. Adrian tumbled to the ground and lay there, unconscious.

“That’s it! We can knock all the zombified students unconscious so they cannot harm us, so we don’t have to kill them!” Ms Goh (Art) brought up suddenly, eyes lighting up.

“Hey! You knocked out Adrian!” Darren shouted accusingly.

“What do you think you are doing?” Mdm Sim (CL) chided Darren.

“Yeah! You should teach us all to make that potion!” Mr Ong (SC), still as enthusiastic about chemistry as ever, grinned.

“That’s not what we meant! Don’t let Darren hear you!” Mdm Tang (Cooking) shushed Mr Ong (SC).

“Ah!” Yi Shen shriek pierced the air, and everyone turned around to see him collapsing onto the ground and a netball flying in the opposite direction.

“What are you waiting for? Start using these netballs to shoot!” Ms Lee (PE) asked, picking up another netball and shooting it towards Zewei, who had just turned into a zombie, netball-style. The ball landed squarely on Zewei’s head and with a yelp of pain he crumpled to the ground.

“Hey what’s this?” Ms Yick (Music) wondered out loud, picking up a piece of paper.

“Looks like some Chinese words. What could they mean?” Mr Mark (Comp) asked curiously.

“I can help to translate it with Mdm Sim (CL). Wait, there are Malay words at the back of the paper!” Ms Lie (ACC) pointed out.

“Ms Zhang (ACC) and I can help with that!” Ms Nora (Malay) offered. “You still remember your conversational Malay, right Ms Zhang (ACC)?” Ms Nora (Malay) inquired, turning to Ms Zhang (ACC).

“Okay, let’s go over to the spectator stands to translate the note because it is further away from this corner.” Ms Zhang (ACC) piped up.

*A few moments later*

“I’m sorry, Riodan but I have to do this.” Ms Ng (Geog) apologised before shooting a netball.

“No! Your posture is wrong! You need to have your arm in a straight line and not use both hands to shoot!” Ms Lee (PE) instructed, demonstrating.

“Ohhh… I get it now!” Ms Poh (Hist) tried to shoot but missed, and her face flushed with embarrassment as she laughed nervously.

“Well at least you looked good while missing.” Ms Lee (PE) assured. “That’s what I always tell my students.”

“AHHH!!!” Christian screamed so shrilly that everyone had to stop and cover their ears for a moment.

The zombified Riodan was biting Christian. Everyone’s faces paled but it was nothing in comparison to the shade of white that Christian’s face had turned.

Everyone waited for Christian to turn into a zombie, but he didn’t.

“Wait what? How is this possible?” Mr Low (Makerspace) asked in disbelief.

“Hmmm… I read somewhere that while most people turn into zombies, some people are asymptomatic, so they do not turn into a zombie.” Ms Vaz (EL) explained.

“Wow! Where did you read that?” The astonished Christian asked.

“As an English teacher I have to read books to expand my knowledge. You should too. It would help with your compositions.” Ms Vaz (EL) replied.

“But the asymptomatic people can also spread the zombie disease.” Mr Low (Makerspace) brought up.

Everyone involuntarily took a step back from Christian.

“Well at least Christian is safe from turning into a zombie.” Sean commented. “I don’t think we should all try to see if we are a-symptomatic though.”

“Guys, the field suddenly feels very empty.” Ms Chang (Cooking) noted.

“I think a few of the boys have disappeared too.” Ms Ng (MA) added.

“AHHH!!!”

“HELP!!!”

“SAVE ME!!!”

“AHHH!!!”

Lucas and Xiangrui who also stopped to help, panicked. Everyone turned to the gate which was closer to the canteen.

“That doesn’t sound like (Random boy) overreacting and screaming in his girly voice.” Xiangrui muttered.

“Yeah, I think it sounds like real girls.” Lucas stated, eyes wide.

At the moment, realisation dawned on the boys and they looked at each other, horrified.

“I’m guessing the girls are in the parade square.” Mr Lee (TRP) interpreted, already knowing what they were about to say.

The boys nodded slowly.

“Let’s go save them then!” Mr Ho (Comp) declared.

"Chewbacca to the rescue!" Mr Chew (PE) shouted, punching his fist into the air, already holding two netballs and a badminton racket to go with him.

Everyone agreed and grabbed as many netballs as they could and darted towards the sound of the screams.

*At the parade square*

“I- wow.” Mrs Chu (SC) breathed out, nearly speechless.

“Hi teachers! Are you here to help us?” Audrey greeted.

“Yeah! I think Audrey, Sharilyn and I are asymptomatic.” Yan Ching informed them.

“Other than that, almost half the girls are zombies now.” Sharilyn added sadly.

“Amazing! I feel so accomplished!” Darren beamed, taking in the scene around him.

“This is getting very serious.” Ms Lee (PE) remarked, glaring at Darren. Everyone nodded in agreement, shuddering at the huge crowd of zombified girls.

“Well, let’s get to work.” Mr Chew (PE) urged, picking up a netball and adjusting his posture to shoot.

“Isn’t it a bit cruel to be trying to hit our friends?” Yan Ching asked, glancing apologetically at Ariel before tossing the ball at her.

“Hey, you have to throw it hard to knock them out you know.” Lucas stated like it was the most obvious thing on earth.

“Not everyone is as heartless as you dude.” Xiangrui teased, punching Lucas playfully on the shoulder.

*A few moments later*

“Guys! We’re done with translating the note!” Ms Zhang (ACC) called out once she came to the parade square with the other teachers, catching everyone else’s attention.

“Really? Quick tell us what it is about!” Ms Vora (E Lit) prompted excitedly.

“Well, it’s about how to cure those who have turned into zombies!” Ms Nora (Malay) revealed. Everyone leaned in, interested, and all ears. Ms Nora (Malay) continued, “The note mentioned a few requirements that need to be done together simultaneously in order for the zombies to return back to their human state.”

“One of them is that the zombies have to eat a banana and walnut cupcake and-” Ms Lie (ACC) began before she was interrupted.

“Banana and walnut cupcake? Didn’t we learn that during our LSP lessons?” Jiangnan, who was listening to the conversation cut in.

“That’s true! We can bake the cupcakes and bring them here for the zombies to cure them!” Jaleen put in, eyes twinkling.

“Ahem.” Ms Lie (ACC) cleared her throat to grab everyone’s attention. “That’s not the only requirement. The zombies have to be fed the cupcakes using a robot.”

“A remote-controlled robot playing a song using the Arduino buzzer. The robot and the buzzer can be programmed separately.” Mdm Sim (CL) added.

“That’s complicated...” Sharilyn muttered.

“At least we don’t need to use our Green Hats to think of a solution because the note already told us.” Mr Lee (TRP) noted.

“Oh and another thing, if after 2 hours of being knocked out, the zombies will disappear forever.” Ms Zhang (ACC) warned, making everyone gasp.

“Well, all we have to do now is split up the job and do it! This way we’ll more likely make it on time.” Ms Poh (Hist) suggested.

“The students can help with the Arduino code because they learnt it in their STEM lessons.” Mrs Chu (SC) brought up.

“They can also help with the baking of the cupcakes.” Ms Chang (Cooking) interjected.

“Wait we don’t have any robots in school that fits this role right? Do we have to assemble one from scratch?” Ms Vaz (EL) asked.

“It’s okay, I can make one with the help of a few students.” Mr Low (Makerspace) offered.

“Then we can write the code to make it move and do what we want!” Mr Ho (Comp) chimed in.

“Okay we need to split up the students and decide who is going with who.” Mr Ng (Comp) began.

“I already did the math. Since each zombie has to eat one cupcake and the cupcakes need to be baked and brought here, 6 students will go with Ms Chang (Cooking) and Mdm Tang (Cooking). 3 students will go with Mr Low (Makerspace) to assemble the robot as there is only one of him. 3 students will go with the computing teachers to write the robot’s code, 3 students will go with Mrs Chu (SC) and Mr Lim (SC) to write the Arduino code and the rest can stay here.” Ms Ng (MA) read off from the list she had made after she counted the number of students that were not zombies.

“Wow... fast...” Sean muttered.

“Also,” Ms Ng (MA) continued, “The cupcakes can be baked in batches of six so at least 4 batches have to be baked. Since the robot has to be assembled then the cupcakes can be used, you can finish baking them before you all come back instead of sending students to come here once one batch is done.”

“As expected of our amazing math teacher.” Josh whispered to the Sean.

“I’m going to go with the Arduino group to make sure it is actually a song.” Ms Yick (Music) volunteered.

“I’m going to follow the Makerspace people, so that the robot doesn’t look too bad.” Ms Goh (Art) piped up.

“You all know how to get to the places right? Just in case you forget…” Ms Ng (Geog) started providing directions for the shortest possible route to each room.

“Wow her mind map of the school is very clear.” Audrey commented.

“Well she taught us about it so of course she would.” Yan Ching grinned.

“Okay! Get to work everyone!” Mr Ng (Comp) announced.

*At the computer room*

The computing teachers decided that the 3 girls would work together on one part of the code while they work together on the rest of the code.

“If you don’t know how to write anything just inform us okay?” Mr Ho (Comp) advised the girls.

“No worries, we’ve got it. We’ll tell you if we need help.” Yu Qing assured the teachers.

The girls started discussing among themselves about which code to write.

“We’ll need to add a bit where the robot can move it’s hand.” Jiangnan stated.

“I wonder how those who are baking the cupcakes are doing.” Jaleen muttered.

*At the cooking room*

“Okay here are the ingredients for the cupcakes. You all can split into pairs to start preparing the cupcakes. Each pair will bake 6 cupcakes.” Mdm Tang (Cooking) instructed the students that were there.

“Do you all still remember how to make the cupcakes? If you have any problem feel free to find any of us.” Ms Chang added, going to her own station to make her own batch.

“Let’s be a pair.” Charmaine suggested to Heather who nodded in agreement. The remaining students grouped themselves into 2 pairs – Jody and Regina, and Sean and Josh.

As they baked, they chatted about their zombified classmates.

“Our classmates that have turned into zombies are so scary!” Jody shivered while mixing the batter.

“I know right, I wonder how it feels to be a zombie!” Regina commented, crushing the walnuts.

“At least we are helping to save them.” Heather said positively.

*Once the cupcakes were done*

“Wow, they smell as amazing as I remember!” Josh remarked, taking a batch of cupcakes out of the oven.

“Mhmmm I wonder if there will be any leftovers for us.” Sean joked.

*At the STEM room*

“Where’s Ms Yick (Music) and Sharilyn?” Audrey queried, scanning the room for them.

“Ms Yick (Music) said she went to the music room to get her score for the notes the buzzer will buzz.” Mrs Chu (SC) mentioned.

“I’m back! I got the notes from the Arduino lessons we had so we can refer to them will writing the code!” Sharilyn popped into the room.

“Thanks! This would help us a lot!” Yan Ching thanked, setting up a laptop.

Mr Lim (SC) handed the girls a breadboard, the buzzer and wires and went to write his part of the code with Mrs Chu (SC).

*At the Makerspace room*

“I’m done designing the robot!” Ms Goh (Art) informed, “Now you can transfer it onto the computer.”

“I have a thumb drive we can use to transfer the diagrams to the machine” Mr Low told the 3 boys that were with him.

Lucas whispered to his friends, “I wonder how the rest of our classmates are doing.”

“Me too, I’m glad we chose this, doing hardware is more fun than software to me.” Christian whispered back.

“Shhh! Mr Low (Makerspace) is coming!” Xiangrui hissed and the 3 of them went back to work.

*Many moments later*

“Okay that’s the last of the zombies.” Mr Ong (SC) panted, wiping the perspiration that had formed on her forehead.

“We’re back!” Charmaine notified everyone in the parade square in a loud voice while balancing a tray. She was followed by 5 other girls and the two cooking teachers.

The smell of cupcakes was so good that everyone started to drool.

“These smell amazing!” Ms Vora (E Lit) praised, “Oh look! The rest are here with the robot!”

Sure enough, Ms Goh (Art) and Ms Yick (Music) were carrying a cute robot together, Mr Low (Makerspace) and the 3 other students following closely behind.

“Be careful! Don’t drop the laptop Jiangnan!” Jaleen shouted when Jiangnan nearly slipped.

“Did you remember to bring the laptop with the Arduino code?” Mr Lim (SC) checked with the rest, holding the breadboard with the buzzer on it.

“It’s here!” Regina replied, pointing at the laptop she was holding.

“Great! Everyone is here! Now let’s connect the robot to the computer.” Mr Mark (Comp) instructed, producing a long wire.

*A few moments later*

“That’s the last of the zombies!” Mr Chew (PE) declared as Yu Qing ate the last cupcake and returned to her human self.

Everyone cheered ecstatically and Ms Yick (Music) made the robot buzz out a new song she had composed.

“Aurgh! You turned everyone back! I can’t believe it! How dare you!” Darren screamed angrily.

“Of course we did, we all worked together as a team!” Ms Ng (Geog) answered, smiling at all the students.

*Extra: Sneak peek for sequel*

All of a sudden, there was a deafening boom and a blinding flash of light. It was so loud and bright that everyone covered their ears and closed their eyes.

After the light cleared, everyone opened their eyes. Everything was the same except that Darren was now lying on the ground as if someone had pushed him over.

“W…what happened?” Darren asked in utter bewilderment.

Baffled, Klemens answered his question with another question, “Huh? Don’t you remember? Are you asking about the bright light?”

“Don’t try to pretend you don’t know Darren. You’re still going to get punished for causing such a disruption in school.” Ms Lee (PE) stated in a dangerous tone.

“What did I do? I can’t even remember why I am here.” Darren was shaking his head in confusion.

“That’s because you were possessed.” A voice suddenly explained.

“By whom?” Darren queried yet again, still befuddled.

“By me.” The same dark sinister voice replied. “Turn around.”

Everybody whipped their head around towards the staircase at the canteen and gasped.

“Happy Friday the 13th.” The mysterious person smirked and with a wave of his hand everyone stopped being able to move.

*Stay tuned for the sequel! 👋≧◉ᴥ◉≦*
