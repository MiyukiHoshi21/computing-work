  It was the 13th of February in the year 2021. Just a random date in the 2021 calendar, right? Wrong. It just so happens that this very day falls on a Friday. The Friday the 13th. <br/>
  You're probably thinking that Friday the 13th does not exist, right? Well, let me tell you a story of what happened in the year 2020. Then let's see if your opinion of Fridsy the 13th is still the same. <br/> 
  "13th of November. One quarter of the end of year school holiday is already gone..." Mr Ong (Science teacher) sighed as he stared at the calendar on the staffroom wall. <br/>
  "I know right? Time flies when we are having fun. Every Friday when we come back to prepare for next year nothing interesting happens and we get dragged back to reality and the fact that the holidays are slipping away at the speed of light." Mr Ho (Computing teacher) added, typing furiously on his computer. <br/>
  "You know, today might not be so boring!" Ms Ng (Math teacher) jumped in excitedly, eyes shining. <br/>
  "Really? Why so?" Ms Vaz inquired, looking up from her computer. <br/>
  "Oh, I know! It's because it's Friday the 13th right?" Mdm Sim (Chinese teacher) asked, glancing at Ms Ng (Math teacher). Ms Ng (Math teacher) nodded vigorously. <br/>
  "You shouldn't believe in this kind of things. We're grown adults and teachers." Ms Lee (PE teacher) commented, pushing a cart of netballs to the PE storeroom. <br/>


Add lots of ghosts and strange, freaky things happening to them (eg things floating around, disturbing visions, howling and moaning, blood on the walls, dark shadows following you) then make it a quest to survie the night/ solve the mystery of the spookiness and then.......................they all wake up. They look at the calender. Friday the 14th. It was all a dream. They all had the same dream though. The next month, it happens again. Every time they die/ fail to solve. they will wake up at the same area again. How can they escape the dream?.....................
