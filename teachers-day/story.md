Story imcomplete! I haven't finished the story yet due to time constaints but I have it fully planned out in my head so try not to give any ideas for the storyline (everything else is okay) because I will not merge it as I already planned it out. Thanks. Enjoy the story. :)

It was the 13th of February in the year 2021. Just a random date in the 2021 calendar, right? Wrong. It just so happens that this very day falls on a Friday. Friday the 13th.
 
You're probably thinking that Friday the 13th does not exist, right? Well, let me tell you a story of what happened in the year 2020. Then let's see if your opinion of Friday the 13th is still the same.
 
"13th of November. One quarter of the end of year school holiday is already gone..." Mr Ong (SC) sighed as he stared at the calendar on the staff room wall.
 
"I know right? Time flies when we are having fun. Every Friday when we come back to prepare for next year nothing interesting happens and we get dragged back to reality and the fact that the holidays are slipping away at the speed of light." Mr Ho (Comp) added, typing furiously on his computer.
 
"You know, today might not be so boring!" Ms Ng (MA) jumped in excitedly, eyes shining behind her pair of red spectacles.
 
"Really? Why so?" Ms Vaz (EL) inquired, glancing up from her computer.
 
"Oh, I know! It's because it's Friday the 13th right?" Mdm Sim (CL) asked, glancing at Ms Ng (MA), who nodded vigorously in response.
 
"You shouldn't believe in this kind of thing. We're grown adults and teachers." Ms Lee (PE) commented, pushing a cart of netballs to the PE storeroom, Mr Chew (PE) following closely behind with another cart.
 
"Yes, it's not scientifically proven that bad things always happen on Friday the 13th." Mrs Chu (SC) remarked before continuing to draw the light diagram she was drawing for her future year 1s.
 
"But it is fun to think about it." Mr Low (Makerspace) put in while planning an activity for his students.
 
"That reminds me, I wonder how is 1H doing, they arranged a meetup in school today." Ms Ng (Geog) pondered out loud, tapping her pencil which she used to draw maps on her chin thoughtfully.
 
"Maybe we can go visit them during our lunch break later." Mr Ng (Comp) suggested, not looking up from the code he was working on.
 
Woosh! All of a sudden, the door to the staffroom was flung open.
 
"Ah, Ms Yick (Music), you're back from the music roo-" Ms Goh (Art) greeted, looking up from a painting she was doing before she was interrupted.
 
"H-help!" All the teachers whipped their heads around only to see (Boy 1) gasping for air. He was trying to stabilize himself by holding onto the door of the staffroom and looked like he had just run a 1000km marathon.
 
"Are you okay (Boy 1)? What happened?" Ms Vora (E Lit) asked concernedly, walking over to him.
 
"I... gasp... the z-zombies... cough cough..." (Boy 1) panted, using his left arm to wipe the beads of sweat that had formed on his forehead.
 
"(Boy 1), calm down! Do you want to take a seat?" Ms Chang (Cooking) pointed at a stool by the door.
 
"Do you need water? I have water." Ms Lie (ACC) offered, holding out a water bottle. 
 
(Boy 1) grabbed the bottle and gulped down the whole drink in 10 seconds. It was a miracle that he didn’t choke. 
 
(Boy 1) looked sheepishly at the teachers for grabbing the bottle earlier but wasted no time in explaining why he was in their staff room. “Help! (Boy 2) has somehow made a potion that caused (Boy 3) to turn into a zombie!”
 
Gasps rippled through the teachers who had gathered around (Boy 1). 
 
“So, how is the situation? Is (Boy 3) infecting other classmates?” Mr Lee (TRP) questioned, analysing the situation, and using his White Hat. 
 
“(Boy 3) said something in a weird voice and tackled (Boy 4) to the ground. Before I knew it (Boy 4) also became a zombie!” (Boy 1) gesticulated wildly as he explained. 
 
Eyes widened one after another. The zombie disease was contagious! 
 
“We need to go save the other kids from 1H! They are not safe as long as they are in the school premises!” Ms Zhang (ACC) exclaimed, already making her way to the staff room door. 
 
“(Boy 1), lead the way!” Ms Nora (Malay) grinned and everyone started following (Boy 1) out of the staffroom. 
 
*A few moments later*
 
“We’re here!” (Boy 1) declared, pointing at the field. “The boys and I were playing soccer here before (Boy 2) came with the potion.” He clarified.
 
Screams could be heard, and all the teachers’ eyes were drawn to a side of the field which had a few boys racing away from it.
 
“Run! Zombies!” (Girl 1) screamed as she rushed past with (Girl 2).
 
“Wait! We are here to help stop (Boy 2)!” Ms Poh (Hist) stopped (Girl 1) and (Girl 2).
 
“You wouldn’t want to be bitten by the zombies and turn into one I tell you.” (Girl 2) warned, terrified.
 
Together, (Girl 1) and (Girl 2) sprinted away.
 
“Let’s get help from other students.” Mdm Tang (Cooking) muttered, shaking her head.
 
“Do you need any help?” (Boy 5) queried as he neared the group of teachers.
 
“Okay so we know that the zombie disease can spread by biting like rabies.” Mr Lim (SC) began.
 
“It’s hard if you want to both stop the zombies and stop them from biting you though.” (Boy 1) piped up.
 
“Wait, let’s get closer to see how many people are infected first.” Mr Mark (Comp) suggested. Everyone nodded in agreement.
 
*At the corner of the field*
 
“Holy cow! Th-they look so different y-yet so recognisable!” Ms Vora (E Lit) stuttered, pointing at the group of zombies.
 
The zombies looked exactly like the boys they were except they had purple hair, green skin with rotting parts and part of their brain was visible. Everyone shuddered as they stared at the zombified version of (Boy 3), (Boy 4) and (Boy 8).
 
“Brainsssssss” (Boy 8) groaned and suddenly lunged toward Mrs Chu (SC).
 
“Look out!” (Boy 9) who just happened to be dashing past yelled and pushed Mrs Chu out of the way.
 
(Boy 8) changed direction and started stumbling toward (Boy 9), only to get whacked in the head by the triumphant Mr Lim (SC) with a tennis racket that happened to be lying nearby. (Boy 8) tumbled to the ground and lay there, unconscious.
 
“That’s it! We can knock all the zombified students unconscious so they cannot harm us so we don’t have to kill them!” Ms Goh (Art) brought up suddenly, eyes lighting up.
 
“Hey! You knocked out (Boy 8)!” (Boy 2) shouted accusingly.
 
“What do you think you are doing?” Mdm Sim (CL) chided (Boy 2).
 
“Yeah! You should teach us all to make that potion!” Mr Ong (SC), still as enthusiastic about chemistry as ever, grinned.
 
“That’s not what we meant! Don’t let (Boy 2) hear you!” Mdm Tang (Cooking) shushed Mr Ong (SC).
 
“Ah!” (Boy 3) shriek pierced the air and everyone turned around to see him collapsing onto the ground and a netball flying in the opposite direction.
 
“What are you waiting for? Start using these netballs to shoot!” Ms Lee (PE) asked, picking up another netball and shooting it towards (Boy 10), who had just turned into a zombie, netball-style. The ball landed squarely on (Boy 10)’s head and with a yelp of pain he crumpled to the ground.
 
“Hey what’s this?” Ms Yick (Music) wondered out loud, picking up a piece of paper.
 
“Looks like some Chinese words. What could they mean?” Mr Mark (Comp) asked curiously.
 
“I can help to translate it with Mdm Sim (CL). Wait, there are Malay words at the back of the paper!” Ms Lie (ACC) pointed out.
 
“Ms Zhang (ACC) and I can help with that!” Ms Nora (Malay) offered. “You still remember your conversational Malay, right Ms Zhang (ACC)?” Ms Nora (Malay) inquired, turning to Ms Zhang (ACC).
 
“Okay, let’s go over to the spectator stands to translate the note because it is further away from this corner.” Ms Zhang (ACC) piped up.
 
*A few moments later*
 
“I’m sorry, (Girl 3) but I have to do this.” Ms Ng (Geog) apologised before shooting a netball.
 
“No! Your posture is wrong! You need to have your arm in a straight line and not use both hands to shoot!” Ms Lee (PE) instructed, demonstrating.
 
“Ohhh… I get it now!” Ms Poh (Hist) tried to shoot but missed.
 
“Well at least you looked good while missing.” Ms Lee (PE) remarked. “That’s what I always tell my students.”
 
“AHHH!!!” (Girl 4) shrieked so shrilly that everyone had to stop and cover their ears for a moment.
 
The zombified (Girl 3) was biting (Girl 4). Everyone’s faces paled but it was nothing in comparison to the shade of white that (Boy 12)’s face had turned.
 
Everyone waited for (Girl 4) to turn into a zombie but he didn’t.
 
“Wait what? How is this possible?” Mr Low (Makerspace) asked in disbelief.
 
“Hmmm… I read somewhere that while most people turn into zombies, some people are asymptomatic, so they do not turn into a zombie.” Ms Vaz (EL) explained.
 
“Wow! Where did you read that?” The astonished (Girl 4) asked.
 
“As an English teacher I have to read books to expand my knowledge. You should too. It would help with your compositions.” Ms Vaz (EL) replied.
 
“But the asymptomatic people can also spread the zombie disease.” Mr Low (Makerspace) brought up.
 
Everyone involuntarily took a step back from (Girl 4).
 
“Well at least (Girl 4) is safe from turning into a zombie.” (Boy 7) commented. “I don’t think we should all try to see if we are a-symptomatic though.”
 
“Guys, the field suddenly feels very empty.” Ms Chang (Cooking) noted.
 
“I think a few of the boys have disappeared too.” Ms Ng (MA) added.
 
“AHHH!!!”
 
“HELP!!!”
 
“SAVE ME!!!”
 
“AHHH!!!”
 
(Boy 13) and (Boy 14) who also stopped to help, panicked. Everyone turned to the gate which was closer to the canteen.
 
“That doesn’t sound like (Random boy) overreacting and screaming in his girly voice.” (Boy 14) muttered.
 
“Yeah, I think it sounds like real girls.” (Boy 13) stated, eyes wide.
 
At the moment, realisation dawned on the boys and they looked at each other, horrified.
 
“I’m guessing most of the girls are in the parade square.” Mr Lee (TRP) interpreted.
 
The students nodded slowly.
 
“Let’s go save them then!” Mr Ho (Comp) declared.
 
"Chewbacca to the rescue!" Mr Chew (PE) shouted, punching his fist into the air.
 
Everyone agreed and grabbed as many netballs as they could and darted towards the sound of the screams.
