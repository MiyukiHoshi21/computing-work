Hi I'm Katherine from Dunman High School. 

I like to: 
1. Write stories
2. Sing
3. Draw (comics and cartoons)
4. Watch anime

I am writing a kind of fiction story for Teacher's Day. I hope you guys will like it. ^_^

NOTE: A lot of you didn't tell me which positions you wanted so I ended up using a random number picker to randomsly pick your register numbers. Please don't kill me. Thanks. (ᵔᴥᵔ)
